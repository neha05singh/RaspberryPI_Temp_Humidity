# IoT Environmental Monitoring with Simulated Raspberry Pi
This repository contains a Python script designed to simulate environmental monitoring using a Raspberry Pi. The script mimics the behavior of a DHT sensor, generating simulated temperature and humidity data. The data is then sent to ThingSpeak, an IoT analytics platform, for logging and visualization.

# Features:
Simulates temperature and humidity readings using a mock DHT sensor.
Sends simulated data to ThingSpeak for data logging and visualization.

# Note:
This code is designed for simulation purposes and does not require a physical Raspberry Pi or DHT sensor. It demonstrates the process of sending simulated environmental data to ThingSpeak for data visualization.
